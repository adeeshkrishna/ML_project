Machine learning project to predict the success of bank marketing campaign using random forest classifier

# Bank Marketing Campaign Success Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for my first machine learning project, aimed at predicting the success of bank marketing campaigns. The project was inspired by a report from the Ministry of Statistics highlighting a decline in India's household savings rate.

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the success of bank marketing campaigns. By identifying key factors that influence campaign outcomes, banks can optimize their strategies to better reach potential customers and encourage savings.

# Background
According to the Ministry of Statistics, India's household savings rate has declined from 22.7% of GDP in 2020-21 to 18.4% in 2022-23. This trend underscores the importance of effective financial strategies to encourage savings and financial stability. This project aims to use machine learning to predict the success of bank marketing campaigns, thereby helping financial institutions optimize their strategies.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes such as age, job type, marital status, and previous campaign outcomes.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:

Normalization using MinMaxScaler
Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder
Balancing the dataset with oversampling techniques

# Modeling
A Random Forest Classifier was chosen as the final model due to its high accuracy. The following steps were taken:

Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model
Training the model on the processed dataset

# Evaluation
The model was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy and the ROC curve. The ROC curve was plotted to visualize the performance of the model.

# Streamlit Web App
A Streamlit web app was developed to allow users to interact with the model. Users can input various demographic and campaign-related attributes to predict the likelihood of a campaign's success.

# Results and Insights
The model provided valuable insights into factors that influence the success of bank marketing campaigns. These insights can help banks tailor their marketing efforts more effectively.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in addressing economic challenges. By leveraging data-driven insights and a user-friendly web app, we can empower financial institutions to make informed decisions and positively impact financial behaviors.
